# Day 2 â€“ Linux CLI & Shell Scripting

## What I Learned

- Basic Linux commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`
- File permissions using `chmod`
- How to write/run a shell script (`.sh`)
- Using `date`, `pwd`, and command substitution (`$(...)`)
- Making scripts executable
- Intro to `if` conditionals and variables in Bash

## Scripts I Created

- `hello.sh`: Prints name, date, and current directory
- `status_check.sh`: Checks if I'm in the correct folder and gives colored feedback
- `log_timestamp.sh`: Appends the current time to a log file
- `create_projects.sh`: Creates a batch of folders using a loop

## What I Struggled With

- Understanding the structure of Bash conditionals
- Need to remember to `chmod +x` before running scripts
- Color formatting with `\033` escape codes

## GitHub Activity

- All files committed and pushed to `day2/` folder in `devops-playground` repo
