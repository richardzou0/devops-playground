# Day 1 – Python Foundations

## Topics Covered:

- Variables, input/output
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- File I/O
- os, sys, subprocess

## Reflections:

Setup Git/GitHub SSH successfully. Reviewed basics of Python and built a few small scripts.

## Notes:

- subprocess is really powerful — great for automation
- Remember to handle exceptions early in script

- note the error during "try.. except" blocks
